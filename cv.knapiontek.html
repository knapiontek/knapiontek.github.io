Employment Experience
11/2007 - present Micro Focus (formerly IONA Technologies, Dublin)
Micro Focus delivers middleware solutions. Main products are Orbix
and Artix. Orbix is the leading implementation of CORBA. Artix is
successor of Orbix and is based on Web Services and implements ESB.
Main responsibilities:
<li>Last year development task was delivery of full integration of Orbix</li>
C++ with Actional. Actional is monitoring tool. It gives users of
Orbix full ability to snoop CORBA invocations and track errors.
<li>Mantainace of existing code. Bugfixes and debugging</li>
Platforms: SunOS, Linux, Windows, HP-UX, AIX
08/2004 - 10/2007 Aircraft Management Technologies (Malahide, Ireland)
AMT delivers specific aircraft software solutions for airlines. The
main focus of the system is management and replication of distributed
databases where connections between airborne planes and the airport
server is not always guaranteed. The system optimizes a connection
price (SAT, GPRS, GSM, Wireless) and an amount of data to achieve
minimum costs and maximum usability.
Involved in:
<li>Design and implementation of a subscription and publishing data</li>
system (XPath filters define data flow between aircrafts and ground
server)
<li>Design and implementation of a large content management system</li>
(transport of files by means of available media and protocols)
<li>Significant improvement of speed of the system core (migration</li>
from JDBC-based client to PL/SQL procedures - avoiding unnecessary
network traffic, further optimisation)
<li>Adaptation of the company software to the Boeing hardware (JNI)</li>
<li>Embedding Java applications in an OS environment (Windows and</li>
Linux API)

09/2001 – 06/2004 Systherm-Info (Poznan, Poland)
Main revenue stream - distributed spatial data systems for government
departments (numeric maps, GIS and database applications). The primary
project was a spatial data manager. The system created a graphics
view of remote databases. User was obtaining current or past state of
the reality. The system had ability of simultaneous work with a few
databases (SQL Server, Oracle and Pervasive) all at once. The system
had a general mechanism to extend the interface for a new kind of a
database.
Involved in:
<li>Design and implementation of multidimensional index for specific</li>
applications (indexing vector objects in a storage)
<li>Design and implementation of a drawing system (fast geometric</li>
algorithms)
<li>Design and implementation of transport layer</li>
<li>Replication and data merging system (i.e. merging two map snapshots</li>
of different time-stamp)
<li>High level functions for users of the system engaged in entering</li>
data
06/1999 – 09/2001 Xnet Communications (Poland, German subsidiary)
The company specialized in network communication. Tasks related to
implementation of systems controlling data flow in the network (e.g.
acquisition of data from distributed cash-registers). The central unit
of the system was an FTP server and a scheduler. The engine was
configured with Lua scripts (see lua.org).
Involved in:
<li>Implementation of distributed file management system (core and</li>
GUI)
<li>Implementation of transport layer based on modems</li>
<li>Implementation of the FTP client and extensions of FTP server</li>
<li>SMTP implementation</li>
Languages
<li>English - fluent</li>
<li>Polski - native</li>
<li>Espa˜nol - learning</li>
Interests
<li>Rock Climbing</li>
<li>Applied Mathematics</li>
